##   Compressed data base module.  Auxiliary routines to open and manipulate a data base for
##     which the sequence and read information are separated into two separate files, and the
##     sequence is compressed into 2-bits for each base.  Support for tracks of additional
##     information, and trimming according to the current partition.  Eventually will also
##     support compressed quality information.

##     (not containing a . !).
##  A DAM is basically a DB except that:

##           in the file .<dam>.hdr file
##     2. .origin contains the contig # of the read within a fasta entry (assembly sequences
##           contain N-separated contigs), and .fpulse the first base of the contig in the
##           fasta entry
##  Open the given database or dam, "path" into the supplied HITS_DB record "db". If the name has
##    a part # in it then just the part is opened.  The index array is allocated (for all or
